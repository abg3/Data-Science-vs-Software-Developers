# Data Scientists vs Software Developers
 A survey analyis of Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results 2019

# Project Motivation
The motivation behind this analysis is to explore how data scientists compare with software developers. A decade ago and even today, data scientist is the most sought after job. However, within the last few years, machine learning has progressed immensely. Model training has become automated with the rise of cloud computing technologies and data scientists barely work on models rather more on data preprocessing which directly involves coding. From job perspective, it is more about handling the data to give it an appropriate structure to feed into our models. It is less about research and experimentation of different models. I am curious to find out if this is the case, is it wiser to become a software developer rather than the much-hyped data scientists? Can you break into data science without software development? I am keen on discovering answers to some of the below interesting questions:

- What percentage of professional developers are satisfied in data science career?
- What is the demographic profile of software developers vs data scientists in terms of gender, age and sources of education?
- What are the top 10 programming languages data professionals favour and how do they differ from software developers?
- Is professional coding experience required to become data scientists? What is their average professional coding experience?
- Do data scientists prefer to work from home than software developers? (P.S.- I am looking forward for the survey responses of 2020)
- Among the two, who has a better work life balance?

# Summary of Results

- Most data scientists have advanced degrees such as Masters/PhD and they are emerging from various backgrounds. However, majority of the respondents from the data science community studied Computer Science in their undergraduate majors.Â 
- Secondly, formal education is not the only source of knowledge to become a data scientist. This journey strongly revolves around industry certifications, online courses and open source contributions.
- The programming languages for a data scientist is not limited to Python and SQL. If you are someone who enjoys shell scripting or  front end development, data science may be a career for you. These skills are becoming popular for ML cloud platforms and data storytelling.
- Software development is an integral part to become a data scientist. Predominantly, professional software developers have shown satisfaction in a data science career. Both professions have a good work life balance, and the survey results demonstrate a unique resemblance between the two i.e the proportion of people spending a better life than not is almost same irrespective of being a software developer or a data scientist.
